Today was February 29th and it was the first day of class since I have been studying 
almost a month and a half of Javascript and about 2 weeks of Jave since the last
I have tested.  

I am a little frustrated as I am torn between wanting to learn new techniques in
Java so I can pass the upcoming test we are going to have.  I find myself wanting
to practice more object oriented logic than dealing with learning the html and 
the css over again.  I think it is because I have so much riding on this program
and I do not want to fail again.  I know failing is part of the process of becoming
a programmer but I need to start moving forward for my own state of mind.

Today I did learn a lot more about GitHub so it was very beneficial.  I also learned
more about key/value pairs in Java while my computer was charging in the other room
during the rest of the github practice.  I will keep this folder updated everyday
with the new concepts that I learn and it will help me keep track of my progress
better in the future.
