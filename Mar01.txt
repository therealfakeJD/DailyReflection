Today we had a more in depth lecture about HTML and CSS.  I feel like this lecture
was way more in depth than the first time I had it last December.  I learned how
to create a new repository in github that would double as a host for a personal
website that I could edit in the future as I learn new ways to change it.  I am
also trying to continue to learn new ways to program in Java.

I am looking forward to being able to start a new project in Java now that I 
have to means to actually ask questions that can point me in the right direction.
At the moment I am trying to find a good website to teach me how to come up with
the logic to solve Java coding challenges.  I can do basic programming in Java and
I just need to learn techniques to start programming for how users will interact
with the programs.  I do need to start getting more rest though because I notice
that I have been running out of energy to interact with people half way through 
the day.
