Today we had a more in depth lecture about HTML and CSS.  I feel like this lecture
was way more in depth than the first time I had it last December.  I learned how
to create a new repository in github that would double as a host for a personal
website that I could edit in the future as I learn new ways to change it.  I am
also trying to continue to learn new ways to program in Java.

I am looking forward to being able to start a new project in Java now that I 
have to means to actually ask questions that can point me in the right direction.
At the moment I am trying to find a good website to teach me how to come up with
the logic to solve Java coding challenges.  I can do basic programming in Java and
I just need to learn techniques to start programming for how users will interact
with the programs.  I do need to start getting more rest though because I notice
that I have been running out of energy to interact with people half way through 
the day.

Reflection for April 6th 2016..

I have been working on my humane society shelter project like a madman and it is still not turning out the way i want it to.  Although the good thing is it will compile so I will be able to get a grade on this project unlike the other ones.  I have had many sleepless nights and I worry about being able to get a job when I leave.  I have learned a ton in the past 2 days so it feels like I have gotten through my learning barrier.  Typically I can sit down and if I concentrate then the code eventually comes.  It is still hard and I just want to be proud of myself for once instead of so defeated.  I keep moving forward but it is hard.  Such is life.
